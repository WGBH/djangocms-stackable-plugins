Description: # 1.0. Stackable Plugins
        
        Stackable Plugins are a set of Django CMS plugins to make it easy for content managers to build somewhat custom pages.
        
        They fall into two broad categories:
        
        1. Page Framework plugins - where you can create grids of content;
        2. Custom Function plugins - these are a loose library of plugins that were created for past projects.
        
        ## 1.1. Features
        
        1. Each plugin has one or more renderers.  This allows the content to be rendered/displayed in different ways.  For example a generic list that contains callouts with an image, title, and short description, can be rendered as a list, in a grid, in a slideshow, or in a carousel (or in any other way your designer might dream up!), but the *content* is the same.   You can switch between renderers on the fly!
        
        2. You can add renderers to any plugin.
        
        3. Some plugins (like the Generic Container) can have children plugins.   
        
        
        ## 1.2. Quick start
        
        1. Install and set up Django CMS
        
        2. Add "stackable_plugins" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::
        
            ```
            INSTALLED_APPS = [
                ...
                'stackable_plugins',
            ]
            ```
            
        3. Run `manage.py migrate stackable_plugins`
        
        # 2.0 The Plugins
        
        ## 2.1. Page Framework Plugins
        
        These allow you to "frame out" the content within a page's placeholder.
        
        ### 2.1.1. GenericContainerPlugin
        
        Fundamentally, this is just a box of other plugins.  It's a way to segregate content on the page when you need that content treated as a group.
        
        ### 2.1.2. GenericListPlugin
        
        This is a wrapper for a list of curated content.   The items in the List do NOT have to be of the same type:  you can create a list with an Image, a Video, then a blob of text, then another Video, then a List within the List, etc.
        
        ### 2.1.3. GenericSeparatorPlugin
        
        This is a way to make fancy content separators (the most generic of which is the `<hr>` tag).
        
        Typically this is used with a separator image.
        
        ### 2.1.4. GenericButtonPlugin
        
        Why have a link when you can have a button?
        
        These are very customizable!  
        
        * Links can be External or Internal OR to a File (e.g., a PDF File);
        * The link target can be to a new window, etc.;
        * You can use any custom CSS class to render the generic button;
        * You can set attibutes on the button (colors, etc.)
        
        ## 2.2. Content Plugins
        
        These plugins have more structured content but have somewhat generic functions: e.g., a video player that can be used for YouTube, PBSMM, Vimeo, etc.
        
        ### 2.2.1. ImageWithThumbnailPlugin
        
        This plugin has an Image plus additional commonly-used metadata:
        
        * main image (with height and width)
        * thumbnail image (with height and width)
        * caption text (can be HTML content)
        * credit/copyright text
        
        Note that the thumbnail image and the main image do not have to be the same (i.e., that the thumbnail is just a resized version of the main image).
        
        ### 2.2.2. HostedVideoPlugin
        
        This is a generic video container.   Each video is attached to a HostService (e.g., YouTube, Vimeo, etc.) and has a unique ID at that service, plus additional metadata:
        
        * Title
        * Duration
        * Description
        
        ## 2.3. Really Special Plugins
        
        These plugins were created for past projects.
        
        ### 2.3.1. BiographyPlugin
        
        Biography container with headshot, byline, and bio.
        
        ### 2.3.2.  CountdownClockPlugin
        
        Displays the time until a future date/time.
        
        Fields available:
        
        * t_minus = time as a `datetime.timedelta` (days, seconds, microseconds)
        * total_seconds = "How many seconds are left?"
        * in_the_past = "are we past the deadline"
        * t_minus_days, t_minus_hours, t_minus_minutes, t_minus_seconds = the time left so you can format is as 3d 14h 32m 06s if you wanted to
        * unixtime = the countdown "zero point" expressed as a UNIXTIME (e.g., 1550762809) - useful for some Javascript libraries (see below).
        * unixtime_now = the time of the page load as a UNIXTIME
        
        Note that this plugin does NOT include the functionality to provide a real-time counting down.   For that you'd need to install a Javascript library and create a custom renderer (see below) to run it, using some of the fields above to "seed" it.   (There are several different JS libraries for this out there.)
        
        
        ### 2.3.3. CompareTwoThingsPlugin
        
        This basically allows for a side-by-side comparison of two things, e.g., "Let's Compare Wolverine vs. Cyclops".
        
        # 3.0. Customization - Adding Renderers
        
        You can create your own renderers for any of these plugins.
        
        In your `settings.py` file, you need to add the `ADDITIONAL_PLUGIN_RENDERER_TEMPLATES` dict.   It has the following format:
        
        ```
        ADDITIONAL_PLUGIN_RENDERER_TEMPLATES = {
            'GenericButtonPlugin':
                [
                    (   'my_special_button',
                        'Special Button',
                        'foo_templates/special_button.html',
                        'Use this renderer if you want things to be REALLY special.'
                    ),
                ],
        }
        ```
        
        Each key in `ADDITIONAL_PLUGIN_RENDERER_TEMPLATES` is one of the custom plugins.  The value is a list of tuples, each of which is a renderer for that plugin.  So you can create as many as you'd like.
        
        The tuple has 4 items:
        
        1. The slug for the renderer;
        2. The title (shown on the renderer dropdown when you're using the plugin);
        3. The location of the rendering template;
        4. Some descriptive help text about how this renderer works.
        
        At present you can't remove any of the built-in renderers.
